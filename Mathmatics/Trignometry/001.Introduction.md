## Trigonometric functions

Normally these functions defines the ratio between the sides of a right triangle.

We cannot use it if the triangle is not right angled.

Here are the functions and their definitions:

$$sin(\theta) = \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}$$
$$cos(\theta) = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}$$
$$tan(\theta) = \frac{opposite}{adjacent}$$

and their inverse functions:
