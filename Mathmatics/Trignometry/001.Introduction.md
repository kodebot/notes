## Trigonometric functions

Normally these functions defines the ratio between the sides of a right triangle.

We cannot use it if the triangle is not right angled.

In other words, $\theta$ must be $$0 \le \theta \le 90$$


Here are the functions and their definitions:

$$
sin(\theta) = \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse} \\
cos(\theta) = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse} \\
tan(\theta) = \frac{opposite}{adjacent} \\
$$

the mnemonic is `SOH CAH TOA`

and their reciprocal functions are:

$$
cosec(\theta) = \frac{hypotenuse}{opposite}
sec(\theta) = \frac{hypotenuse}{adjacent}
cot(\theta) = \frac{adjacent}{opposite}
$$
