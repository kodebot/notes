    "This formative coursework has the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To illustrate and develop skills of basic Python programming. \n",
    "* To help you get used to coding in the Jupyter environment\n",
    "  using this kind of coursework specification format, in which\n",
    "  the instructions and your answers are given in the same notebook file.\n",
    "* To show you the semi-automated program testing and grading systems\n",
    "  that will be used for the programming assignment on this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work will consist of defining a number of functions according to given specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be given a bare skeleton function; just giving the function name, arguments and a dummy return value. To answer the questions, you need to fill in code within the\n",
    "template functions in order to create a working function that fulfils the\n",
    "given requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automatic Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to check that your functions are working correctly, by running a testing function defined in the Python file `A1_Formative_tests.py`. You should download this file and put it in the same directory as this file (`P4DS_Formative_A1.ipynb`).\n",
