# Desired State Config Management

Once VM is created, some settings need to applied/adjusted to reach desired state

Easy way to think of this is that this is the config we do inside the VM as opposed to outside (generally done by DevOps)

Supported Extensions
* puppet - enterprise grade
* CHEF - enterprice grade
* Powershell (DSC) - simple and easy to use, reco for small scale

Powershell DSC config can be ported to puppet or CHEF
