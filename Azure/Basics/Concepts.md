# How Azure works?

Azure uses virtualisation called `Hypervisor` to decouple os and the hardward and runs many virtual machines on one machine.

Physical Server + Hypervisor = Many virtual servers

* Microsoft has datacenters across the world
* Each datacenter has many racks
* Each rack has many servers

A rack has many servers connected to a network switch
