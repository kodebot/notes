    "\n",
    "* world is full of uncertainties that we want to measure\n",
    "\n",
    "* probability theoretical study of measuring certainty that an event will happen\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "* probability is how strong we believe an event will happen\n",
    "\n",
    "  * usually referred in percent or 0.0 to 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "* P(X) = 0.7\n",
    "\n",
    "  * notation for probability\n",
    "\n",
    "  * X - expected event\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Probability vs. Likelihood**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `Probability` is quantifying predictions of events yet to happen (future)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * sum of probabilities of all mutually exclusive event must be 1\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * `Likelihood` is measuring the frequency of events already happened (past)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * sum of events totalling to 1 is not applicable for likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "* complement\n",
    "\n",
    "  * probability of an event must be between 0 and 1\n",
    "\n",
    "  * this means we can calculate the probability of event not happening as\n",
    "\n",
    "    * P(not A) = 1 - P(A)\n",
    "\n",
    "      * this is referred to as complement rule\n",
    "\n",
    "* odds\n",
    "\n",
    "  * probability can be expressed as odds\n",
    "\n",
    "    * 7/3, 7:3, 2.333\n",
    "\n",
    "    * to convert odds to probability\n",
    "\n",
    "      * $ P(X) = \\frac{O(X)}{1 + O(X)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "    * probability to odds\n",
    "\n",
    "      * $ O(X) = \\frac{P(X)}{1 - P(X)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "  * odds are used in gambling/betting context as it it intuitive to understand\n",
    "\n",
    "    * for example odds of 2:1 means, the event is 2 times more likely to happen than not\n",
    "\n",
    "      * if expressed in percentage it will be 66.66 but 2:1 is more easy to understand\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability vs Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "* `probability` is purely theoretical of how likely an event is likely to happen, no data is required\n",
    "\n",
    "* on the other hand, `statistics` uses data to discover probability and provides many tools to describe data"

    "* example\n",
    "\n",
    "  * $ P(COFFEE | CANCER) = 0.85 $\n",
    "\n",
    "    * probability of people drink coffee given they have cancer is 85%\n",
    "\n",
    "    * this does not mean there is 85% chance of getting cancer if you drink coffee\n",

    "      * $ P(CANCER | COFFEE) \\not = 0.85 $\n",
    "\n",
    "    * $ P(COFFEE) = 0.65 \\space and \\space P(CANCER) = 0.05 $\n",
    "\n",
    "      * we need to take rarity of the cancer into account not just the normality of drinking coffee\n",
    "\n",
    "    * based on the normality of coffee drinking and rarity of cancer, probability of getting cancer given drinking coffee is very low \n",
    "\n",
    "      * this can be calculated by Bayes's theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "      * $ P(A|B) =\\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "      * memory trick - think of $P(A|B) \\space as \\space P(A)/P(B)$ then we just need to multiply numerator by $P(B|A)$\n",
    "\n",
    "      * so $ P(CANCER | COFFEE) = \\frac{0.85 \\times 0.005}{0.65} = 0.0065 $\n",

    "### Joint and Union Conditional Probabilities\n",

    "* example, consider we want to find the probability of coffee drinks AND cancer patients\n",
    "\n",
    "  * we can apply simple product rule $ P(COFFEE) \\times P(CANCER)$\n",
