    "# Descriptive and Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "* statistics - practice of collecting and analysing data to discover findings that are useful or predict what causes those findings\n",
    "\n",
    "* machine learning in itself is a statistical tool\n",
    "\n",
    "* lot of blind sides in statistics, even for experienced professional - forgetting to see where the data comes from\n",
    "\n",
    "  * this problem gets even more significance as are automating most of the statistical algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "* good to have solid understanding of statistics and hypothesis testing to avoid treating statistical automation as black box\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* data provides snapshots of a story\n",
    "\n",
    "  * may be biased\n",
    "\n",
    "  * may have gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "  * may be missing relevant data\n",
    "\n",
    "* data itself is not important but analysis and how it is collected is\n",
    "\n",
    "* not just source of truth, also source of AI\n",
    "\n",
    "* process of collecting data focused on a particular objective is *data mining*\n",
    "\n",
    "* data provides clues, not truth\n",
    "\n",
    "  * clues may lead to truth or erroneous conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "* should be curious on where the data comes from\n",
    "\n",
    "  * garbage in garbage out\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ground Truth\n",
    "\n",
    "* correct/factual or true answer to a specific problem (rather than the one obtained by agent/sensor)\n",
    "\n",
    "* if an self-driven car fails to see a pedestrian on the road through its camera, can it not detect the failure and stop?\n",
    "\n",
    "  * no it can't as the system has no access ground truth. So no ground truth for it to fallback unless some other system or human provides it\n",
    "\n",
    "## Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "* *descriptive statistics* summarises/describes data\n",
    "\n",
    "* *inferential statistics* tries to uncover attribute about larger population with a smaller sample\n",
    "\n",
    "  * could be wrong as our sample may not be representative of the population\n",
    "\n",
    "## Populations, Samples and Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "* a *population* is a particular group of interest we want to study\n",
    "\n",
    "  * example - all golden retrievers in Scotland\n",
    "\n",
    "  * does not have to tangible - it can be abstract too\n",
    "\n",
    "    * example - we want to study all the fights taking off between 2am and 3am\n",
    "\n",
    "      * not enough data for that time so our population is very small\n",
    "\n",
    "      * now we treat that population as sample - sample of all theoretical flights between 2am and 3am \n",
    "\n",
    "      * theoretical fights are abstract population\n",
    "\n",
    "* a *sample* is subset of a population that we are interested in\n",
    "\n",
    "  * usually random and unbiased\n",
    "\n",
    "  * sample must be as random as possible to avoid skewed conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "* bias\n",
    "\n",
    "  * inevitable that our data will be biased\n",
    "\n",
    "    * so many `confounding variables` and factors\n",
    "\n",
    "      * confounding variable - unmeasured third variable that influences\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * only way to overcome this is by being truly random\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Whirlwind tour of Bias Types\n",
    "\n",
    "  * geographical bias\n",
    "\n",
    "  * self-selection bias\n",
    "\n",
    "    * a specific group more likely include themselves in a sample\n",
    "\n",
    "    * example - conducting a poll on social media to find Netflix users - because they have internet so may be using Netflix more than non-social media users so it is not representative\n",
