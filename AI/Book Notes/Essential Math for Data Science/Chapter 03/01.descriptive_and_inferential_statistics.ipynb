    "\n",
    "* when data has many outliers then median is better as it is less sensitive to outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "* when mean and median are very different then the data is skewed by the outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "* median is `50% quantile` where 50% of the data is less than or equal to it\n",

    "\n",
    "      * also absolute values are not easy to work with in derivatives - NOT SURE WHY?\n",

    "* this is to reduce the bias in the sample data and underestimate population variance\n",
