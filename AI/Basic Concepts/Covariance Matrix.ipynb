    "# Covariance Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix filled with covariances between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance indicates direction of relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive value indicates both variables tend to high or low at the same time. (positive covariance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative value indicates when one variable is high the other will be low and vice versa. (negative covariance)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very similar to correction expect that correlation is bounded between -1 and 1 and we don't have that limitation with covariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude indicates how strong the relationship is provided the scales are appropriate to compare for both variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we have N datapoints with two variables x and y\n",

    "\n",
    "Covariance of x and y `cov(x,y)` is same as covariance of y and x `cov(y,x)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance/Variance can be calculated as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ cov(x,y) = \\mathbb{E}(x \\times y) - \\mathbb{E}(x)\\mathbb{E}(y) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbb{E}$ is expected value and in this case it is just the mean.\n",

    "$$ Sample = [\\bold{x_1, x_2, ...x_N}]\\text{ in }\\mathbb{R}^D $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means $\\bold{x_1, x_2, ... x_N} $ are vectors and each vector is made D of real numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "So the dimension of Sample is $N\\times D$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, closed form covariance matrix $S$ is\n",
    "\n",

    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\bold{\\bar{x}}$ is mean of $\\bold{x}$ vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $(\\bold{x_i - \\bar{x}})$ is $ D \\times 1 $ column vector and $(\\bold{x_i - \\bar{x}})^\\intercal $ is $ 1 \\times D $ row vector so the result is $ D \\times D $ vector.\n",
