# Notes

Notes on various topics that I've learned and want to remember.

## Supported files

* Jupyter notebooks
* Markdown files
* excalidraw files

## Excalidraw

With excalidraw extension installed, you can name the file with `.excalidraw.png` extension and it will be rendered as png when linked in markdown files and still editable.

## KaTeX and MathJax

vscode uses KaTeX for displaying TeX in the markdown preview but Github uses MathJax so sometimes TeX will be appear correctly in vscode preview but not in the Github. If this happens make sure MathJax variation is used correctly. More info on MathJax can be found [here](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference).
