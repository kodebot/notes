# ADM Guidelines and Tools

There are 9 key techniques to apply ADM

![ADM Guide](./img/adm-guidelines-techiniques.excalidraw.png)

## Architecture Principles

* Enduring set of general rules and guidelines about the architecture

  * Enduring because these hardly changes

    * Defined in preliminary phase

    * Broken down into

        ![Arch principles](./img/arch-principles.excalidraw.png)

  * Examples

    * using off the shelf software rather than custom build

    * designated trustee for all shared databases who ensures quality

  * Five elements of good principle

       ![Good Principle](./img//good-principle.excalidraw.png)

    * Understandability

      * Easier to understand what the principle is talking about and easy to understand if you are violating the principle

      * No vague, gray area

    * Robustness

      * Definitive and precise even in complicated or controversial situations

    * Completeness

      * should cover every potential situations

    * Consistency

      * some times principles might be slightly conflicting and having some sort of priority for them help making consistent decisions

        * for example, there are two principles - using third party software and keeping data secure.

        * if no third party software can be found that securely stores data then if the priority is to have secure data, we can go for custom software

    * Stability

      * stable and hardly changes

## Stakeholder Management

* Stakeholder is an individual, team, org, or class thereof, having an interest in an a system

* As an architect, being able to win support for your plans is a skill

  * explain how your plans help them

  * know who are the powerful stakeholders

  * (good SH management skill) makes it easier for approvals and budgets

  * establish communication plans

    * how often to communicate

    * what level of details to include

  * Read the room, identify problems and conflicts early in order to avoid them

## Architecture Patterns

* idea that has been useful in one practical context and will probably useful in others - M. Fowler

* for example, pattern for spinning up a call center

* Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) and Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) are reusable blocks

* Architecture Patterns is:

  * when, why and how you use ABBs and SBBs

* Arch patterns DO NOT play a big role in the TOGAF standard

  * it is up to you to find existing patterns and use them and not reinvent the wheel

* after been through few ADM cycles, you may have number of building blocks

  * you may want to establish patters for those building blocks so it may help in next ADM cycle

## Gap Analysis

* used throughout ADM cycle

* key step in the BDAT phases and Migration Planning (Phases B-E)

* difference between baseline and target architecture

  * added

  * changed

  * intentionally omitted

  * accidentally omitted (lead to revising target architecture)

* should be easy to explain why something was added or removed

## Migration Planning

* phases E & F are migration planning phases

* these phases contain number of tools to help migration planning

### Implementation factor catalog

* way to document factors that are going to impact migration plan

* implementation factor assessment & deduction matrix

* typically include

### Consolidated gaps, solutions & dependencies matrix

### Architecture definition increments table

### Transition architecture state evolution table

### Business value assessment technique
