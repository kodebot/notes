  ![principles-good-governance](./img/principles-of-governance.excalidraw.png)

  * Discipline

    * following what was agreed

    * not going against what was decided as a group

  * Transparency

    * who is making request and what was the decision are public

    * there is no scenario where request is approved based on who is requesting it

  * Independence

    * minimise conflict of interest

    * for example if Technology team is solely running the governance then the decisions may be favouring technology team

  * Accountability

    * people who are authorised to make decision are also accountable

      * when the decision turned out to be bad one

        * as decisions are transparent and independent

        * we can say this is why the decision was taken and we are happy to be accountable for that

  * Responsibility

    * people involved are required to act responsibly to the org and the stakeholders

  * Fairness

    * no unfair advantage to anyone

* board is the group of people that oversee the implementation of that strategy

  * board is representative of all the key stakeholders in the architecture

  * establish targets, (SBBs, ABBs)

  * enforcement of arch compliance

  * keep up arch capability

  * ensure/oversee key metrics tracked are met

  * once started, the board is ongoing

## Architecture Contracts
