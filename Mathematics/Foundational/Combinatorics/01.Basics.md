# Combinatorics

* permutation interested in order
* combination not interested in order

### Permutation

* example

$$
\{A,B\} = \{AB,BA\}
$$

* permutation of `n` when selecting `r` items with repetition is

$$
nPr = n^r
$$

* permutation of `n` when selecting all items without repetition is $n!$

$$
nPn = n!
$$

* permutation of `n` when selecting `r` items without repetition is

$$
nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$

or

$$
P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$

We read this as `permutation of n when choosing r`

### Combination

* combination of `n` when selecting `r` items without repetition is

$$
nCr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}
$$

* combination of `n` when selecting `r` items with repetition is

$$
nCr = \frac{(n + r - 1)!}{(n-1)!r!}
$$

#### Example

Suppose 4 students out of 12 need to picked for a sports competition. John and Jane are siblings and they want to play together. We need to find the probability of picking them together for the competition

Total possible outcome $\implies$ combination of picking 4 students from 12 is

$$
C(12, 4) = \frac{12!}{(12-4)!4!} = 495
$$

Desired outcome $\implies$ John and Jane takes two places so we left with 2 more places. So we need to find combination of picking 2 from 10

$$
C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{(10-2)!2!} = 45
$$

so,

$$
    P = \frac{45}{495} = 0.091
$$

the probability of John and Jane ending up in the same team is 9.1%
