# Common matrix transformations

## Identity matrix

Identity matrix is a matrix that does nothing

$$
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\
0 & 1\end{bmatrix}
$$

It has ones on leading diagonal and zeros in other places.


## Scaling matrix

Scaling matrix is just a scaled Identity matrix. It scales vector

$$
\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 \\
0 & 3\end{bmatrix}
$$

This matrix scales x by 2 and y b 3
