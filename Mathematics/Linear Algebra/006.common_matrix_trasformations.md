# Common matrix transformations

## Identity matrix

Identity matrix is a matrix that does nothing

$$
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\
0 & 1\end{bmatrix}
$$

It has ones on leading diagonal and zeros in other places.


## Scaling matrix

Scaling matrix is just a scaled Identity matrix. It scales vector space

$$
\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 \\
0 & 3\end{bmatrix}
$$

This matrix scales x by 2 and y b 3

## Upper Triangular Matrix

Upper triangular matrix is a matrix with only zeros below leading diagonal

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\
0 & 4 & 5\\
0 & 0 & 6 \end{bmatrix}
$$

this is also known as `Row Echelon Form`

## Lower Triangular Matrix

Lower triangular matrix is a matrix with only zeros above leading diagonal

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\
2 & 3 & 0\\
4 & 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Rows can be swapped to change this to upper triangular matrix, thus we can say lower triangular matrix is also `Row Echelon Form`

## Diagonal matrix

Diagonal matrix is just a general form of identity or scaling matrix seen above.

Diagonal matrix has some nice properties that makes it very useful

### Matrix Multiplication

* multiplying a matrix by diagonal matrix on the right is simply scaling each column of left matrix by the number from corresponding column on right matrix

$$
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\
3 & 4\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\
0 & 2\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 4 \\
3 & 8\end{bmatrix}
$$

* multiplying a matrix by diagonal matrix on the left is simply scaling each row of right matrix by the number from corresponding row on left matrix

$$
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\
0 & 2\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\
3 & 4\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\
6 & 8\end{bmatrix}
$$

* multiplying two diagonal matrix result in a diagonal matrix

### Matrix Addition

Just add corresponding elements

### Transpose

$$ A^T = A $$  where $A$

### Inverse

### Determinant
