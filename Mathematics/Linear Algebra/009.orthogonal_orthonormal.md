# Orthogonal Matrix and Orthonormal Basis

Matrix is just a set of column vectors.

When a matrix is orthogonal, it means the vectors that are part of the matrix is perpendicular to each other.

Additionally, if each of the vector is unit vector (norm / magnitude / length = 1), then we can call those vectors are Orthonormal basis vectors.

## Orthonormal Basis Properties

Set of vectors $V = \{v_{1}, v_{2}, ...v_{n}\}$ form an orthonormal basis if the follow properties are true for all of them

* vector dotted with itself should be 1 
    $$v_{i}.v_{i} = 1 $$
* any vector dotted with any other vector should be 0
