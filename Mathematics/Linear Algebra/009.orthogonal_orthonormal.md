# Orthogonal Matrix and Orthonormal Basis

Matrix is just a set of column vectors.

When a matrix is orthogonal, it means the vectors that are part of the matrix is perpendicular to each other.

Additionally, if each of the vector is unit vector (norm / magnitude / length = 1), then we can call those vectors are Orthonormal basis vectors.

## Orthonormal Basis Properties

Set of vectors $V = {v_{1}, ..., v_{n}}
