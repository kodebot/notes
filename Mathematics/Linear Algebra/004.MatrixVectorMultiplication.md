# Matrix Vector Multiplication

Matrix vector multiplication is not different from matrix multiplication. It is just that one of the matrix (in this case the second matrix) is N x 1, that is N row and 1 column

We can see this in different perspective from system of linear equations.

For example,


3a + b = 8

a - 2b = 5

can be written as following in row view

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 1 \\
1 & -2
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}

=
\begin{bmatrix}
8 \\
5

\end{bmatrix}

$$

and can be written as following in **column view**

$$
a \sdot \begin{bmatrix}
3 \\
1 
\end{bmatrix}

+

b \sdot \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
-2
\end{bmatrix}

=
\begin{bmatrix}
8 \\
5

\end{bmatrix}

$$

this is some scaled linear combination of two vectors (lets call them x and y) is the result vector.
