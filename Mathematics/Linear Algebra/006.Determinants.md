# Determinants

Lets take a matrix

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
$$

when we plot this (as row vector) and close the loop, it will look like this

Determinant is the area of the parallelogram (for 3D it is volume)

which is `ad - bc`

* determinant can be found only for square matrix
* it helps to see if can find inverse of a matrix


When we think of matrix as linear transformation, the determinant is the factor by which the linear transformation changes any area.
