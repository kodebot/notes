# Matrix multiplication (Cross Multiplication)

Matrix of M x N means M rows and N columns

We can multiply two matrix if the rows in first matrix matches the columns in the second matrix.

The resulting matrix will have same number of rows as in matrix 1 and same number of columns as in matrix 2.

that is

We can multiple [M x N] and [N x O] (the inner numbers N match)
and the result will be [M x O] matrix (the outer numbers)

## Row view

when we multiply matrix think of them in the following way


$$
\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\
c & d \\
\end{bmatrix}
\times

\begin{bmatrix} r_{1i} & r_{1j} \\
r_{2i} & r_{2j} \\
\end{bmatrix}

=

\begin{bmatrix}
a.r_{1i} + b.r_{2i} & a.r_{1j} + b.r_{2j} \\
c.r_{1i} + d.r_{2i} & c.r_{1j} + d.r_{2j} \\
\end{bmatrix}

$$

here we are 
* taking `a` times row 1 and adding that with `b` times row 2 to get resulting row 1
* and then taking `c` times row 1 and adding that with `d` times row 2 to get resulting row 2


## Properties
* not commutative - A x B != B x A
