# Linear Independence

When a vector cannot be reached by linear combination of other vectors then those vectors are linearly independent.

## Useful to know

* Orthogonal vectors are linearly independent
* Numerically, linear independence indicates whether features that are making up the vector are correlated or independent of each other

## Numerical example

### Linearly dependent

Consider a cafe modelling the price of raw materials of coffee and tea in vector.

$$
raw\space materials = \begin{bmatrix}milk \\
sugar\\
\end{bmatrix},\space
tea = \begin{bmatrix}1\\
1\\
\end{bmatrix},\space
coffee = \begin{bmatrix}2\\
1\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

when we plot this we can see vectors point generally in the same direction. From this we can conclude that the price of tea and coffee are correlated as the use same raw materials but of slightly different quantity.

Lets say the coffee decides to offer another drink, chocolate milk and its cost is as follows

$$
choc\space milk = \begin{bmatrix}3\\
2\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We can clearly see `choc milk` is linear combination of `tea` and `coffee`. so `choc milk` is linearly dependent.

### Linearly independent

Consider other two products `cake` and `frozen yogurt` with the follow raw material matrix

$$
raw\space materials = \begin{bmatrix}dough \\
yogurt\\
\end{bmatrix},\space
cake = \begin{bmatrix}2\\
0\\
\end{bmatrix},\space
frozen\space yogurt = \begin{bmatrix}2\\
1\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
