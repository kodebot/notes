# Linear Independence

When a vector cannot be reached by linear combination of other vectors then those vectors are linearly independent.

## Useful to know

* Orthogonal vectors are linearly independent
* Numerically, linear independence indicates whether features that are making up the vector are correlated or independent of each other

## Numerical example

Consider a cafe modelling the price of raw materials of coffee and tea in vector.

$$
raw\space materials = \begin{bmatrix}milk \\
sugar\\
\end{bmatrix},\space
tea = \begin{bmatrix}1\\
1\\
\end{bmatrix},\space
coffee = \begin{bmatrix}3\\
1\\
\end{bmatrix}

$$
