# Linear Independence

When a vector cannot be reached by linear combination of other vectors then those vectors are linearly independent.

## Useful to know

* Orthogonal vectors are linearly independent
* Numerically, linear independence indicates whether features that are making up the vector are correlated or independent of each other
