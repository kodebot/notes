# What is it?

3a + b = 8

a - 2b = 5

Set of equations relating one or more (equal) number of unknowns.

We call them `system` because it is collection of interrelated parts work together number of unknowns.

and it is linear because if we plot each of the equations it will be a line 

This can be written as matrix and vector multiplication

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 1 \\
1 & -2
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}

=
\begin{bmatrix}
8 \\
5
\end{bmatrix}

$$

**coefficient matrix `x` unknown vector = result vector**

$ A\vec{x} = \vec{b} $
