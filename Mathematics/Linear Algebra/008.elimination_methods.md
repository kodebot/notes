# Elimination methods

## Gaussian Elimination

Gaussian Elimination is one of the methods for solving systems of linear equations.

It is a two step process

* convert matrix to `row echelon form`
* resolve unknowns by `back-substitution`

### Augmented Matrices

System of linear equations can be written as augmented matrix

For example,

3a + b = 8

a - 2b = 5

can be written as

$$\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 &\bigm| &8 \\
1 & -2 &\bigm| &5\\
\end{bmatrix}$$

this is augmented version of

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\
1 & -2 \\
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix} a \\
b\\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix} 8 \\
5\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

once we have this augmented matrix, we can apply series of row operations to each rows to find `a` and `b`.

* the row operations can be

  * scalar multiplication and division (scale up or down)

  * add or subtract one row from another (add non-zero scalar multiples of rows)
  * swap rows (Only allowed in Gauss Jordan Elimination)

* the row operations CANNOT be
  * adding or subtracting scalar values
  * dividing one row by another (not sure what it would even mean ðŸ˜„)

The goal of this process is to reach a form of a matrix where lower triangle is 0.

$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 &\bigm| &1 \\
0 & 1 &\bigm| &-1\\
\end{bmatrix}$$

This matrix is called `Row Echelon Form`.

From this we get the value for `b` as -1. We can `back-substitute` this to the first equation to get value of `3` as 3.


$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 &\bigm| &3 \\
0 & 1 &\bigm| &-1\\
\end{bmatrix}$$

so we know a = 3 and b = -1

This method is called `Gaussian Elimination`

We first get to a form of a matrix were lower triangle of the matrix is zero. This matrix is called `Row Echelon Form`. Once we get to this form, then it is very easy to find the unknowns.

example of `Row Echelon Form` (not a real example)

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 5 & 3 &\bigm| &8 \\
0 & 4 & 2 &\bigm| &-3\\
0 & 0 & 3 &\bigm| &14\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
