# Change of basis (vector)

A vector can be seen as linear combination of basis vectors of that vector space.

All the spaces that can be reached by linear combination of vectors is called `span` or `vector space` of those vectors.

2 orthogonal basis vectors of 2D coordinate system can cover the entire
