# Change of basis (vector)

## Span

A vector can be seen as linear combination of basis vectors of that vector space.

All the points that can be reached by linear combination of vectors is called `span` or `vector space` of those vectors.

2 orthogonal basis vectors of 2D coordinate system can cover the entire plane. So the `span` of such vectors is the entire plane. For 3D coordinate system, it will be 3D space.
