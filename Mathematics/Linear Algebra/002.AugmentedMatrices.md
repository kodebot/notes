# Augmented Matrices 

System of linear equations can be written as augmented matrix

For example,

3a + b = 8

a - 2b = 5

can be written as

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 1 &\bigm| &8 \\
1 & -2 &\bigm| &5\\
\end{bmatrix}

$$

once we have this augmented matrix, we can apply series of operations to each rows to find `a` and `b`.

the operations can be 
    * scalar multiplication and division
    * add or subtract one row from another
    * swap rows

the operations cannot be
    * adding or subtracting scalar values
    * dividing one row by another (not sure what it would even mean ðŸ˜„)

The goal is to get the coefficient to 1 in one of row's `a` position and make other values to be zero and repeat this for all the unknowns. So the above matrix will reduce to

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 &\bigm| &3 \\
0 & 1 &\bigm| &-1\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

so we know a = 3 and b = -1
