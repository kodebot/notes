# Augmented Matrices 

System of linear equations can be written as augmented matrix

For example,

3a + b = 8

a - 2b = 5

can be written as

$$ \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 &\bigm| &8 \\
1 & -2 &\bigm| &5\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

once we have this augmented matrix, we can apply series of row operations to each rows to find `a` and `b`.

the row operations can be 
* scalar multiplication and division (scale up or down)
* add or subtract one row from another (add non-zero scalar multiples of rows)
* swap rows

the row operations CANNOT be
* adding or subtracting scalar values
* dividing one row by another (not sure what it would even mean ðŸ˜„)

The goal is to get the coefficient to 1 in one of row's `a` position and make other values to be zero and repeat this for all the unknowns. So the above matrix will reduce to

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 &\bigm| &3 \\
0 & 1 &\bigm| &-1\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

so we know a = 3 and b = -1

This method is called Gaussian Elimination

We first get to a form of a matrix were lower triangle of the matrix is zero. This matrix is called `Row Echelon Form`. Once we get to this form, then it is very easy to find the unknowns.


example of `Row Echelon Form` (not a real example)

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 5 & 3 &\bigm| &8 \\
0 & 4 & 2 &\bigm| &-3\\
0 & 0 & 3 &\bigm| &14\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
