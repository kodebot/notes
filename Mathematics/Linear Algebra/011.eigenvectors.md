# Eigenvectors

Eigenvector can be defined in the context of matrix transformation such that when the transformation is applied, the vector may be scaled by direction remains that same.

$$
A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v}
$$

where

$A$ is transformation matrix

$\lambda$ is scaling factor, also referred to as `eigenvalue`

$\vec{v}$ is `eigenvector`

There may be many linearly independent or no eigenvector for a transformation.

## How to calculate?

We can rewrite the following to

$$
A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v}
$$

to

$$
A\vec{v} - \lambda\vec{v} = 0
$$

and make the $\lambda$ matrix as well to allow matrix subtraction

$$
A\vec{v} - \lambda I\vec{v} = 0 \\
(A - \lambda I)\vec{v} = 0
$$

Now we need to find a value(s) for $\lambda$ such that the determinant of $(A - \lambda I)$ should be zero

$$
det(A - \lambda I) = 0
$$

**NOTE:** we could also get 0 when the $\vec{v} = 0 $ but that is a trivial solution and not in our interest so we need to find a non trivial solution where $\vec{v} \not= 0$.

Now if we expand this as follow

$$
det\left(\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\
c & d \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}\lambda & 0 \\
0 & \lambda \end{bmatrix}\right) = 0
$$

&nbsp;

$$
det\left(\begin{bmatrix} a - \lambda & b \\
c & d - \lambda \end{bmatrix}\right) = 0
$$

the polynomial (aka. characteristic polynomial) for the determinant would be

$$
(a - \lambda)(d - \lambda) - bc = 0
$$

$$
\lambda^2 - (a + d)\lambda + ad - bc = 0
$$

if we substitute value for `a`, `b`, `c` and `d`, we will get possible values for $\lambda$ using
