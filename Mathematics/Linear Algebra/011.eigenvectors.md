# Eigenvectors

Eigenvector can be defined in the context of matrix transformation such that when the transformation is applied, the vector may be scaled by direction remains that same.

$$
A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v}
$$

where

$A$ is transformation matrix

$\lambda$ is scaling factor, also referred to as `eigenvalue`

$\vec{v}$ is `eigenvector`

There may be many linearly independent or no eigenvector for a transformation.

## How to calculate?

We can rewrite the following to

$$
A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v}
$$

to

$$
A\vec{v} - \lambda\vec{v} = 0
$$

and make the $\lambda$ matrix as well to allow matrix subtraction

$$
A\vec{v} - \lambda I\vec{v} = 0 \\
(A - \lambda I)\vec{v} = 0
$$
