# Eigenvectors

Eigenvector can be defined in the context of matrix transformation such that when the transformation is applied, the vector may be scaled by direction remains that same.

$$
A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v}
$$

where

$A$ is transformation matrix

$\lambda$ is scaling factor, also referred to as `eigenvalue`

$\vec{v}$ is `eigenvector`

There may be many linearly independent eigenvalue for a transformation
