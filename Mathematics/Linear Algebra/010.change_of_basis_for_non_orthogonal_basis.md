# Change of basis (for non orthogonal basis)

If the target basis vectors are orthogonal, we can change the basis of the vector by projecting the vector on to the target basis vectors and  create a new vector from the projections linear combination.

This is computationally inexpensive and preferred if the basis vectors are orthogonal.

But if the target basis vectors are not orthogonal then we have to use matrix for the transformation.

## Example

Lets say we use the following basis vectors in the Earth

$$
\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 
0\end{bmatrix} \space and \space \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 
1\end{bmatrix}
$$
