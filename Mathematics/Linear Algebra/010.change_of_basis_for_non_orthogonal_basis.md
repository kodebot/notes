# Change of basis (for non orthogonal basis)

If the target basis vectors are orthogonal, we can change the basis of the vector by projecting the vector on to the target basis vectors and  create a new vector from the projections linear combination.

This is computationally inexpensive and preferred if the basis vectors are orthogonal.

But if the target basis vectors are not orthogonal then we have to use matrix for the transformation.

## Example

Lets say we use the following (orthonormal) basis vectors in the **`Earth`** forming matrix $E$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 
0\end{bmatrix} \space and \space \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 
1\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
E = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\ 
0 & 1\end{bmatrix}
$$

and the following basis vector in **`Mars`** written in our Earth's coordinate system forming matrix $M$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 
2\end{bmatrix} \space and \space \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 
1\end{bmatrix}
$$


$$
E = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\ 
0 & 1\end{bmatrix}
$$

Mars basis vector is not orthonormal and not even orthogonal.

Now, lets say we have vector $\vec{v_m}$ (written) in Mars coordinate system

$$
\vec{v_m} = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\
1\end{bmatrix}
$$

Now to convert this to Earth's coordinate system, we need to left multiply the vector $\vec{v_m}$ by matrix of Mars basis vectors written in Earth's coordinate system
