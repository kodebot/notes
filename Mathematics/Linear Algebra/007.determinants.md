# Determinants

Determinant of a square matrix is a scaler value indicating the factor by which the area is scaled.

Lets take a matrix

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
$$

when we plot this (as row vector) and close the loop, it will look like this

* Determinant is factor by which the area has changed by the linear transformation.

* In this example, the area of the parallelogram (for 3D it is volume)

which is `ad - bc`

> **memory trick: think that you are writing the strokes of X**

* determinant can be found only for square matrix
* it helps to see if inverse of a matrix exist

* When we think of matrix as linear transformation, the determinant is the factor by which the linear transformation changes any area

* If a determinant of a matrix is zero then it means, the transformation pushes everything into a smaller dimension (for 2D it could be a line or a point).

* Negative value indicates the orientation is flipped.

ðŸ”´**IMPORTANT**ðŸ”´ **If determinant of a matrix is zero then there is no inverse, i.e. we cannot reverse the result of the transformation.**

* if the determinant is negative then it means the orientation is changed by the transformation.

## Inverse matrix

Inverse of a matrix is a matrix that reverses the transformation.

$$
    AA^{-1} = I = A^{-1}A
$$

$I$ is identity matrix

### using adjugate or adjunct matrix and determinant

Adjugate of

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\
c & d \end{bmatrix}
$$

is

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\
-c & a \end{bmatrix}
$$

determinant of $A$ is `ad - bc`


$$
    A\space adj(A) = det(A)I
$$

$$
   \frac{1}{det(A)} A\space adj(A) = I
$$

$$
   \frac{1}{det(A)}\space adj(A) = A^{-1}
$$

Example

$$
\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\
c & d \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\
-c & a \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} ad-bc & 0 \\
0 & ad-bc \end{bmatrix}
$$


$$
\frac{1}{ad-bc} \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\
c & d \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} ad-bc & 0 \\
0 & ad-bc \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 
\\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$


$$
\frac{1}{ad-bc}  \begin{bmatrix} ad-bc & 0 \\
0 & ad-bc \end{bmatrix} = A^{-1}
$$
