# Determinants

Determinant of a square matrix is a scaler value indicating the factor by which the area is scaled.

Lets take a matrix

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
$$

when we plot this (as row vector) and close the loop, it will look like this

* Determinant is factor by which the area has changed by the linear transformation.

* In this example, the area of the parallelogram (for 3D it is volume)

which is `ad - bc`

* determinant can be found only for square matrix
* it helps to see if inverse of a matrix exist

* When we think of matrix as linear transformation, the determinant is the factor by which the linear transformation changes any area

* If a determinant of a matrix is zero then it means, the transformation pushes everything into a smaller dimension (for 2D it could be a line or a point).

* Negative value indicates the orientation is flipped.

* if the determinant is negative then it means the orientation is changed by the transformation.

## Inverse matrix

Inverse of a matrix is a matrix that reverses the transformation.

$$
    AA^{-1} = \lambda I = A^{-1}A
$$

$\lambda$ is $\frac{1}{determinant}$

$I$ is identity matrix
