## Observational study

* requires only observing variable of interest
  * i.e. observe things that already happen in nature
  * example - study time vs. exam score

* Correlation or Association does not imply Causation
  * example - there is strong correlation between study time and exam score but that doesn't mean longer study time automatically gets you higher exam score
  * there may be other variables like IQ, motivation, sleep, etc..
