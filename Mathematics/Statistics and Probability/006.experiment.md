# Experiments

## Observational study

* requires only observing variable of interest
  * i.e. observe things that already happen in nature
  * example - study time vs. exam score

* Correlation or Association does not imply Causation
  * example - there is strong positive correlation between study time and exam score
    * but that doesn't mean longer study time automatically gets you higher exam score
    * student who studied less got high scores as well
  * there may be other variables like IQ, motivation, sleep, etc..
    * these are `lurking variables`
      * hidden variables affect the relationship between `explanatory variable` and `response variable`
* To avoid lurking variables an experiment must be performed
