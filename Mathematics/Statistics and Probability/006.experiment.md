# Experiments

## Observational study

* requires only observing variable of interest (only observe)
  * i.e. observe, measure and make association from things that already happening in nature
  * example - study time vs. exam score

* Correlation or Association does not imply Causation
  * example - there is strong positive correlation between study time and exam score
    * but that doesn't mean longer study time automatically gets you higher exam score
    * student who studied less got high scores as well
  * there may be other variables like IQ, motivation, sleep, etc..
    * these are `lurking variables`
      * hidden variables affect the relationship between `explanatory variable` and `response variable`
* To avoid lurking variables an experiment must be performed

## Experiment

* provoking and observing response by doing something (treatment) to someone (experimental unit) rather than just observing
* involves applying a treatment to experimental unit

### Experimental unit

* refers to anything that the experiment is being performed on
* human experimental unit is referred to as `subject`

### Factors

* refers to explanatory variable of an experiment
  * example: brand of toothpaste and brushing time when studying oral health improvement

### Factor levels

* refers to experimental condition applied to the experimental unit
* i.e. particular value of factors
* example - colgate and 2 minutes

### Treatment

* refers to combination of factor level applied to an experimental unit

### Example of an experiment

An experiment is being conducted to study effectiveness of brushing time (1 minute and 2 minutes) and toothpaste brand (Colgate and Aquafresh) on oral health. 3 healthy individuals are chosen to treat at each combination of factor levels. After 10 days the level of oral health will be compared.

* Response variable
  * level of oral health
* Experimental unit
  * health human
* Factors
  * toothpaste brand and brushing time
* Factor levels
  * brushing time
    * 1 minute
    * 2 minutes
  * toothpaste brand
    * colgate
    * Aquafresh
* Treatment (4 factor levels combination)
  * (1 minute brushing time and colgate)
  * (2 minute brushing time and colgate)
  * (1 minute brushing time and Aquafresh)
  * (2 minute brushing time and Aquafresh)
* Number of individuals needed
