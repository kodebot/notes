# Experiments

## Observational study

* requires only observing variable of interest (only observe)
  * i.e. observe, measure and make association from things that already happening in nature
  * example - study time vs. exam score

* Correlation or Association does not imply Causation
  * example - there is strong positive correlation between study time and exam score
    * but that doesn't mean longer study time automatically gets you higher exam score
    * student who studied less got high scores as well
  * there may be other variables like IQ, motivation, sleep, etc..
    * these are `lurking variables`
      * hidden variables affect the relationship between `explanatory variable` and `response variable`
* To avoid lurking variables an experiment must be performed

## Experiment

* provoking and observing response by doing something (treatment) to someone (experimental unit) rather than just observing
* involves applying a treatment to experimental unit

### Experimental unit

* refers to anything that the experiment is being performed on
* human experimental unit is referred to as `subject`

### Treatment

### Factors

### Factor levels
