# Probability Basics

* a percent chance of something happening
* **Sample Space**
  * all possible outcome
* sum of probability of all possible outcome must be 1 (100%)
* outcomes may have even probability (odd) or weighted probability(odd)

* calc
$$
    probability = \frac{desired/favourable \space outcome}{total \space possible \space outcome}
$$

* probability of an outcome must range between 0 and 1 (inclusive)

## Classical Probability

* event event has equal chance
* example coin flipping or drawing a card from a deck


## Empirical Probability

* based on experimental or historical data
* example - probability of a team winning football game (based on their past match results)


## Subjective Probability

* based on someone's knowledge or experience
* it is not statistical but just an indicator of confidence of someone about something happening or not happening based on their knowledge and/or experience

## Even Odds vs. Weighted Odds

* even odds mean each outcome has equal chance
  * coin flip - head and tail has equal chance
  * rolling dice - each result has equal chance
  * usually dependent on **one variable**

* weighted odds mean each outcome has non equal chance
  * weather - 20% rain and 80% not rain
  * sport - team A winning chance 40% and team B winning chance - 60%
  * usually dependent on **multiple variables**

## Permutation and Combination

* permutation interested in order
* combination not interested in order

### Permutation

* example

$$
\{A,B\} = \{AB,BA\}
$$

* permutation of `n` when selecting all items is $n!$

$$
nPn = n!
$$

* permutation of `n` when selecting `r` items is

$$
nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$

or

$$
P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$

We read this as `permutation of n when choosing r`

### Combination

* combination of `n` when selecting `r` items is

$$
nCr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!x!}
$$

### Example

Suppose 4 students out of 12 need to picked for a sports competition. John and Jane are siblings and they want to play together. We need to find the probability of picking them together for the competition
