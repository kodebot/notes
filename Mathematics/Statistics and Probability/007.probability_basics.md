# Probability Basics

* a percent chance of something happening

$$
    probability = \frac{desired/favourable \space outcome}{total \space possible \space outcome}
$$

* value range between 0 and 1 (inclusive)

## Classical Probability

* event event has equal chance
* example coin flipping or drawing a card from a deck


## Empirical Probability

* based on experimental or historical data
* example - probability of a team winning football game (based on their past match results)


## Subjective Probability

* based on someone's knowledge or experience
* it is not statistical but just an indicator of confidence of someone about something happening or not happening based on their knowledge and/or experience

## Even Odds vs. Weighted Odds

* even odds mean each outcome has equal chance
  * coin flip - head and tail has equal chance
  * rolling dice - each result has equal chance
  * usually dependent on **one variable**

* weighted odds mean each outcome has non equal chance
  * weather - 20% rain and 80% not rain
  * sport - team A winning chance 40% and team B winning chance - 60%
