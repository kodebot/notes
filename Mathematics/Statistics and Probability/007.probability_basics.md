# Probability Basics

* a percent chance of something happening
* more formally - the likelihood of an event occurring
* **Sample Space**
  * all possible outcome
* sum of probability of all possible outcome must be 1 (100%)
* outcomes may have even probability (odd) or weighted probability(odd)

* calc
$$
    probability\space P(A) = \frac{desired/favourable \space outcome}{total \space possible \space outcome}
$$

* probability of an outcome must range between 0 and 1 (inclusive)

## Classical/Theoretical/True Probability

* event event has equal chance
* example coin flipping or drawing a card from a deck


## Empirical Probability

* based on experimental or historical data
* example - probability of a team winning football game (based on their past match results)


## Subjective Probability

* based on someone's knowledge or experience
* it is not statistical but just an indicator of confidence of someone about something happening or not happening based on their knowledge and/or experience

## Even Odds vs. Weighted Odds

* even odds mean each outcome has equal chance
  * coin flip - head and tail has equal chance
  * rolling dice - each result has equal chance
  * usually dependent on **one variable**

* weighted odds mean each outcome has non equal chance
  * weather - 20% rain and 80% not rain
  * sport - team A winning chance 40% and team B winning chance - 60%
  * usually dependent on **multiple variables**

## Permutation and Combination

* permutation interested in order
* combination not interested in order

### Permutation

* example

$$
\{A,B\} = \{AB,BA\}
$$

* permutation of `n` when selecting all items is $n!$

$$
nPn = n!
$$

* permutation of `n` when selecting `r` items is

$$
nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$

or

$$
P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$

We read this as `permutation of n when choosing r`

### Combination

* combination of `n` when selecting `r` items is

$$
nCr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}
$$

#### Example

Suppose 4 students out of 12 need to picked for a sports competition. John and Jane are siblings and they want to play together. We need to find the probability of picking them together for the competition

Total possible outcome $\implies$ combination of picking 4 students from 12 is

$$
C(12, 4) = \frac{12!}{(12-4)!4!} = 495
$$

Desired outcome $\implies$ John and Jane takes two places so we left with 2 more places. So we need to find combination of picking 2 from 10

$$
C(10, 2) = \frac{10!}{(10-2)!2!} = 45
$$

so,

$$
    P = \frac{45}{495} = 0.091
$$

the probability of John and Jane ending up in the same team is 9.1%

## Percentile

* indicates what is the position in the rank
* 95% percentile means part of top 5%

* calc
  * many ways are available and they are different
  * the following is one of simple and accepted methods

$$
percentile = \frac{number\space of\space participant\space below\space ones\space score + 0.5}{total\space participant}
$$

* when we have only few total participants lower percentile may mean higher rank
  * for example 97.5 could be highest rank when we only have 20 participant
* max percentile will not be 100. 99th percentile mean one is in the top 1%
