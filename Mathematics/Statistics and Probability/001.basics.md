# Basics

## What is Statistics?

Collection and interpretation of data

* used to measure and analyse `variability`
  * for example age height, weight and hair color of people in the world

### Types of statistics

* Descriptive
* Inferential

#### Descriptive statistics

* means getting data and talking about it
  * example: average rainfall in London
* often explained with charts such as histogram, time plot, etc..

#### Inferential statistics

* deals with taking and analysing a sample to make judgements or claims about a population

## Common Terminologies

* Population
  * Refers to the total amount of "things"
    * "things" could be anything like cat, virus type, age, planets, etc..

* Sample
  * Small part of the population that is used for study

* Sample Size
  * Total amount of "things" in the population

* Variable
  * What we are studying is variable
    * example: age, height, hair color, etc..
  * they are
    * countable
    * measurable
    * categorised
  * two types
    * quantitative
    * categorical
      * two types
        * categorical ordinal
          * has inherent ordering (i.e. makes sense to order)
            * example: grade
        * categorical nominal
          * no inherent ordering (i.e. doesn't make sense to order)
            * example: hair colour

* Quantitative Data
  * comes from quantitative variables
    * example: age, height, etc...
  * data that is measured in numbers
  * should make sense to perform arithmetic calculations with
    * example: average, sum, etc...

* Categorical data
  * comes from categorical variable
    * example: hair colour, type of cat, etc...
  * refers to values that place "things" into different groups or categories
