# Correlation and Regression

## Correlation (r)

* denoted as `r`
* shows the direction and strength of a `linear relationship` shared between two quantitative variables
* variables can be
  * explanatory and response
  * or unrelated
* can be expressed using scatter plot

### Direction

* correlation show the direction or slope of set of data
* positive `+r` indicates upward slope
  * `r = 1` when data points form perfect upward slope line
    * referred to as `perfect positive correlation`
    * has perfect linear relationship
* negative `-r` indicates downward slope
  * `r = -1` when data points form perfect downward slope line
    * referred to as `perfect negative correlation`
    * has perfect linear relationship

### Strength

* when `r = 0` there the relationship strength is 0
  * meaning there is no correlation between data 
* when value of `r` moves closer to `-1` or `+1` the strength of the relationship increases

### Calculation

$$
r = \frac{1}{(n-1)s_xs_y} \sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}
$$

where:

$\bar{x}$ is mean of `x` axis values

$\bar{y}$ is mean of `y` axis values

`n` is number of data points

$s_x$ standard deviation of `x`

$s_y$ standard deviation of `y`
